## Test

If you have trouble running the test "test:db", add the option "{ debug: true }" to "new MongoMemoryServer()" to find out more about the
reason. On ubuntu 18.04 for example the package "libcurl3" has to be installed in order to get the MongoMemoryServer started.

```javascript
mongoServer = new MongoMemoryServer({ debug: true });
```
